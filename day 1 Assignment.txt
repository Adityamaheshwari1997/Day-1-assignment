1) After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?

output is 23



2) What should the values of the following two terms be?
 "\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n"
   ]

output is:- In first case they add the value let if spam = 3 so s= spam+spam+spam  -> (9) 
            In second case they multiple the value let if spam = 3 so s= s*3  -> (9)  

(feedback :- i thing the answer is wrong but the question is wrong format this is the only reason)
 


"3) How can you tell the difference between break and continue?"

   
output :- break -> Terminate the loop if the condition is true
  
        continue -> used for skip the current argument



"4) In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?"


output:- Python range(10) function generates the immutable sequence of numbers starting from the given start integer to the stop integer{0,1,2 upto 9}. 

        range(0, 10). Here,start=0 and stop = 10. It will generate integers starting from the start number to stop -1
        
        Pass the step value to range(0,10,1)


"5) Using a for loop, write a short programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10 Then, using a while loop, create an identical programme that prints the numbers 1 to 10."

output:- using for loop -> for i is range(10):
                                 print(i)

         using while lop -> i = 1
                            while(i<10):
                              pirnt(i)
                             i+=1

6) Given a number x, determine whether the given number is Armstrong number or not.?


output:-
  
num = 153
sum = 0
temp = num?

while temp > 0:
   digit = temp % 10
   sum += digit ** 3
   temp //= 10


if num == sum:
   print("yes",num,"is an Armstrong number")
else:
   print("No",num,"is not an Armstrong number")


8) Program to Reverse words in a given String in Python."

output:- 

str = "Lets upgrade"
str1 = ""

for i in str:
   str1 = i+str1
print(str1)


9)  Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to find the sum of all the elements in the list.

output:-  

l = []
num = int(input('How many numbers: '))
for n in range(num):
    numbers = int(input('Enter number '))
    lst.append(numbers)
print("Sum of elements in given list is :", sum(l))


10) Write a Python program to print all even numbers between 10-1000?

output:-  
 
for num in range(10, 1000):
      
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(num)
